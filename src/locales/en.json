All data will only be for test purposes and will not be moved to official launch.  As this is the first Alpha test there will be various bugs.  If you encounter a bug please contact us at community@mobox.io.<br/><br/><h3>Alpha Test Rules</h3><br/><br/>1. Crates (Staking to yield farm) will only be available for ERC20 USDT, USDC, DAI.  Each account can only stake a maximum of 2000 for each pool.  You can deposit and withdraw from Crates at anytime.<br/><br/><span style='color:red'>Note: As this is an alpha test staking will take place on Ethereum mainnet while all other operations will take place on Rinkeby.  When useds stake in Crates, we will send Rinkeby ETH to their wallet address to be used for other operations throughout the Alpha test.</span><br/>For the best experience download MOBOX Wallet Plugin :<br/><a href='https://www.mobox.io/download/moboxwallet.zip' target='_blank'>https://www.mobox.io/download/moboxwallet.zip</a><br/><br/>2. Users will be dropped KEYs depending on the weighted average of their staked stablecoins in each Crate.<br/><br/>3. During the Alpha test KEYs cannot be withdrawn to wallets.  They can only be used to unlock BOX at a 1:1 ratio.<br/><br/>4. When BOX is unlocked you will receive an NFT (MOMO). All BOXs must be unlocked before unlocking new BOXs.<br/><br/>5. MOMOs unlocked from BOXs will be automatically staked to farm MBOX tokens.  The amount of MBOX tokens mined will depend on a users weighted average according to total Hash Power.<br/><br/>6.

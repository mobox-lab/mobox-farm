  "Notice_02":"<strong>MBOX Buyback and Burn</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: 4/20/21 (Will begin logging price)</strong><br/><br/>The MBOX buyback and burn has already acuumulated more than $1,200,000 USD. The team will be updating the platform tomorrow to kickstart the system.<br/><br/><strong>Remind me on how it works?</strong><br/>The buyback system is automated through smart contracts. It will calculate the average price in the past 72 hours, and when it drops below that price a randome amount will be bought back using the funds the buyback pool.<br/><br/>Max buybacks per day = 96<br/>Max buyback amount per trigger = 100 BUSD<br/>Max total buyback per day = 9600 BUSD<br/><br/>Burn will take place manually once a month.<br/><br/>All buyback transactions will be shown on the platform ensuring full transparency.<br/><br/><strong>MBOX DAO Token Pool (veMBOX)</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: (TBD)</strong><br/><br/>As many of you have asked, we are currently coding the smart contracts for the MBOX Token Pool. But unlike other pools, the MBOX token pool is a booster pool.<br/><br/><strong>What does that mean?</strong><br/>Depending on your share of the LP pool, users can choose to stake an amount of MBOX tokens and for how long to stake for, receiving an equivalent in veMBOX tokens in return. This will give MOBOXer a BOOST. The max Booster is 3X, meaning that it will increase your weight in the pool by 3X giving MOBOXers the ability to increase their weighted average compared to users who do not stake MBOX tokens.<br/><br/>But that‚Äôs not all! veMBOX will also give users extra attempts in Trade Action. But most importantly, users will vote on MOBOX strategies and changes using their veMBOX tokens.<br/><br/>We expect this to be complete in the coming weeks.<br/><br/><strong>Token Master</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date : 5/20/2021</strong><br/><br/>The first game to launch on the MOBOX platform is MOMO: Token Master. A casual battler where everyone can pit their MOMOs against one another. The game is set in seasons, with each season resetting all stats and leaderboards. In Token Master the goal is to accumulate as many Gold Coins by battling other MOBOXers and stealing their Gold Coins or by playing the Monopoly wheel.<br/><br/><strong>Game Systems</strong><br/><strong>Skills :</strong> MOMOs can accumulate skills depending on the Gems (explained below) they accumulate through MOMO: NFT farmer. Each MOMO can be equipped with 1 Active Skill and 3 Passive Skills. There are a total of 80 Active skills and 100 Passive skills to choose from.<br/><br/>Each MOMO will have 4 skills once they enter the season, with Rare and above having the option to upgrade their skills.<br/><br/><strong>MOMO Gold Mine : </strong>Depending on your total hash rate, MOMO's will accumulate Gold Coins that can be used in the MOMO: Token Master game.<br/><br/><strong>MOMO Battler :</strong> Every MOBOXer gets a set number of attempts daily to steal Gold Coins from other MOBOXers. MOMOs are put into teams where they battle 3v3. For each MOMO defeated the MOBOXer receives a star, and depending on how many Stars the winners receives they will steal a portion of their opponents Gold Coins.<br/><br/><strong>MOMOpoly :</strong> Brining back a great hit, MOBOXers can user their Gold Coins and test their luck on the wheel to accumulate even more Gold Coins!<br/><br/><strong>LeaderBoards: </strong> There will be a total of three leaderboards each giving out MBOX rewards.<br/>a. Token Master : The Token master leaderboard is based on total Gold Coins accumulated for the season.<br/>b. Stars : The Stars leaderboard is based on total Stars accumulated throughout MOMO Battler.<br/>c. MOMOpoly : The MOMOpoly leaderboard is based on the highest multiplier from the lucky wheel.<br/><br/><strong>Gem System</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: 5/8/2021</strong><br/><br/>The Gem system is a brand new NFT system to customize your MOMOs! Using the ERC1155 standard and can be obtained by using MBOX. Only a set amount of Gems will be released daily. Gems will be released according to a MBOX lottery system. MOBOXers participate in the lottery by using their MOBOX. Any MOBOXer who does not receive Gems will have their MBOX tokens returned.<br/><br/> Each Gem starts at level 1 and can be upgraded to level 9. 3 of the same level gems can be combined to upgrade to the next level.<br/><br/>Once the Gem system is launched it will take place 4 times a week. Lottery System will last for roughly 4 weeks and depending on the ecosystem the team will decide whether or not to extend it.<br/><br/><strong>Revolutionary NFT lending Smart Contract system </strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: (TBD)</strong><br/><br/>Didn't we say we are here to revolutionize how users can use and earn with their NFTs? Well now it‚Äôs time to give you guys a little hint of how we are going to approach this. We‚Äôve always said that we want to expand the free to play and play to earn concept and help users around the world find another way to have fun and make an earning.<br/><br/> There are collectors, there are players, and there are investors. Therefore, we have devised a system to bring more value to NFTs where each stakeholder can find some sort of value from them. Introducing the first ever NFT lending Smart Contract.<br/><br/><strong>How does it work?</strong><br/>Owners of rare and epic MOMOs can choose to lend out their NFTs. Lending out NFTs will not effect the users MOMO: NFT Farmer hash power. Other MOBOXers have the choice to rent them and use them within games for a certain amount of MBOX tokens.<br/><br/>This system benefits collectors and investors by giving them another way to earn from their MOMOs, while also giving other players who might not have rare or epic MOMOs the ability to borrow to earn MBOX tokens within games.<br/><br/>Revolutionary? We definetly think so! More to come!<br/><br/><strong>Legendary MOMOs</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: (TBD)</strong><br/><br/>Team MOBOX has been working hard in bringing you the greatest of NFTs. We believe that the importance of interoperability not just between blockchains or games, but also between platforms is the essence of NFTs. Legendary MOMOs shouldn‚Äôt only give you uber Hash Power, but also give you use cases across the blockchain scene. We have been working with several partners in bringing you just that! We will release more news on this once its set in motion. Stay tuned!<br/><br/><strong>MOMO Chat</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date : (TBD)</strong><br/><br/>We have also been working on a chat platform that will be integrated with the whole MOBOX platform allowing MOBOXers from around the world to talk MOMO, MBOX, and really.... anything you want to talk about.",

Normal Lottery: Each phase will contain 100 gems and there will be no limit to the number of participating addresses. To participate users will have to stake a certain amount of MBOX (more info below). Each address can only obtain 1 Gem. <br/>3. Super Lottery: Each phase will contain 400 Gems. There will be a minimum Hash Power to participate (more info below). Each individual address can only obtain a maximum of 10 Gems. If more than 400 Gems are accounted for, then the Super Lottery system will be used with a max of 10,000 available tickets. <br/>4. A ticket number will be given out for each lottery ticket. At the end of the lottery random ticket numbers will be chosen to win Gems. If the number of lottery tickets is less than the number of available Gems, then each participating lottery ticket will receive Gems. <br/>5. Each Lottery Ticket = 5BUSD equivalent in MBOX tokens. The amount of MBOX required for a certain Lottery Phase will be set as soon as the first ticket is purchased. For each Lottery Ticket purchased, the corresponding amount of MBOX will be frozen. At the end of the Lottery Phase, any remaining MBOX tokens can be reclaimed. <br/>6. Lottery Phases will start with Red, Green, Blue, and end with Gold Gems (All Level 1 Gems). <br/>7.

  "Notice_02":"<strong>MBOX Buyback and Burn</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: 4/20/21 (Will begin logging price)</strong><br/><br/>The MBOX buyback and burn has already acuumulated more than $1,200,000 USD.  The team will be updating the platform tomorrow to kickstart the system.<br/><br/><strong>Remind me on how it works?</strong><br/>The buyback system is automated through smart contracts.  It will calculate the average price in the past 72 hours, and when it drops below that price a randome amount will be bought back using the funds the buyback pool.<br/><br/>Max buybacks per day = 96<br/>Max buyback amount per trigger = 100 BUSD<br/>Max total buyback per day = 9600 BUSD<br/><br/>Burn will take place manually once a month.<br/><br/>All buyback transactions will be shown on the platform ensuring full transparency.<br/><br/><strong>MBOX DAO Token Pool (veMBOX)</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: (TBD)</strong><br/><br/>As many of you have asked, we are currently coding the smart contracts for the MBOX Token Pool.  But unlike other pools, the MBOX token pool is a booster pool.<br/><br/><strong>What does that mean?</strong><br/>Depending on your share of the LP pool, users can choose to stake an amount of MBOX tokens and for how long to stake for, receiving an equivalent in veMBOX tokens in return.  This will give MOBOXer a BOOST.  The max Booster is 3X, meaning that it will increase your weight in the pool by 3X giving MOBOXers the ability to increase their weighted average compared to users who do not stake MBOX tokens.<br/><br/>But that’s not all! veMBOX will also give users extra attempts in Trade Action.  But most importantly, users will vote on MOBOX strategies and changes using their veMBOX tokens.<br/><br/>We expect this to be complete in the coming weeks.<br/><br/><strong>Token Master</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date : 5/20/2021</strong><br/><br/>The first game to launch on the MOBOX platform is MOMO: Token Master.  A casual battler where everyone can pit their MOMOs against one another.  The game is set in seasons, with each season resetting all stats and leaderboards.  In Token Master the goal is to accumulate as many Gold Coins by battling other MOBOXers and stealing their Gold Coins or by playing the Monopoly wheel.<br/><br/><strong>Game Systems</strong><br/><strong>Skills :</strong> MOMOs can accumulate skills depending on the Gems (explained below) they accumulate through MOMO: NFT farmer.  Each MOMO can be equipped with 1 Active Skill and 3 Passive Skills.  There are a total of 80 Active skills and 100 Passive skills to choose from.<br/><br/>Each MOMO will have 4 skills once they enter the season, with Rare and above having the option to upgrade their skills.<br/><br/><strong>MOMO Gold Mine : </strong>Depending on your total hash rate, MOMO's will accumulate Gold Coins that can be used in the MOMO: Token Master game.<br/><br/><strong>MOMO Battler :</strong> Every MOBOXer gets a set number of attempts daily to steal Gold Coins from other MOBOXers.  MOMOs are put into teams where they battle 3v3.  For each MOMO defeated the MOBOXer receives a star, and depending on how many Stars the winners receives they will steal a portion of their opponents Gold Coins.<br/><br/><strong>MOMOpoly :</strong> Brining back a great hit, MOBOXers can user their Gold Coins and test their luck on the wheel to accumulate even more Gold Coins!<br/><br/><strong>LeaderBoards: </strong> There will be a total of three leaderboards each giving out MBOX rewards.<br/>a. Token Master : The Token master leaderboard is based on total Gold Coins accumulated for the season.<br/>b. Stars : The Stars leaderboard is based on total Stars accumulated throughout MOMO Battler.<br/>c. MOMOpoly : The MOMOpoly leaderboard is based on the highest multiplier from the lucky wheel.<br/><br/><strong>Gem System</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: 5/8/2021</strong><br/><br/>The Gem system is a brand new NFT system to customize your MOMOs!  Using the ERC1155 standard and can be obtained by using MBOX.  Only a set amount of Gems will be released daily.  Gems will be released according to a MBOX lottery system.  MOBOXers participate in the lottery by using their MOBOX.  Any MOBOXer who does not receive Gems will have their MBOX tokens returned.<br/><br/>  Each Gem starts at level 1 and can be upgraded to level 9.  3 of the same level gems can be combined to upgrade to the next level.<br/><br/>Once the Gem system is launched it will take place 4 times a week. Lottery System will last for roughly 4 weeks and depending on the ecosystem the team will decide whether or not to extend it.<br/><br/><strong>Revolutionary NFT lending Smart Contract system </strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: (TBD)</strong><br/><br/>Didn't we say we are here to revolutionize how users can use and earn with their NFTs?  Well now it’s time to give you guys a little hint of how we are going to approach this.  We’ve always said that we want to expand the free to play and play to earn concept and help users around the world find another way to have fun and make an earning.<br/><br/>  There are collectors, there are players, and there are investors.  Therefore, we have devised a system to bring more value to NFTs where each stakeholder can find some sort of value from them.  Introducing the first ever NFT lending Smart Contract.<br/><br/><strong>How does it work?</strong><br/>Owners of rare and epic MOMOs can choose to lend out their NFTs.  Lending out NFTs will not effect the users MOMO: NFT Farmer hash power.   Other MOBOXers have the choice to rent them and use them within games for a certain amount of MBOX tokens.<br/><br/>This system benefits collectors and investors by giving them another way to earn from their MOMOs, while also giving other players who might not have rare or epic MOMOs the ability to borrow to earn MBOX tokens within games.<br/><br/>Revolutionary? We definetly think so!  More to come!<br/><br/><strong>Legendary MOMOs</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date: (TBD)</strong><br/><br/>Team MOBOX has been working hard in bringing you the greatest of NFTs.  We believe that the importance of interoperability not just between blockchains or games, but also between platforms is the essence of NFTs.  Legendary MOMOs shouldn’t only give you uber Hash Power, but also give you use cases across the blockchain scene.  We have been working with several partners in bringing you just that!  We will release more news on this once its set in motion.  Stay tuned!<br/><br/><strong>MOMO Chat</strong><br/><strong>Estimated Launch Date : (TBD)</strong><br/><br/>We have also been working on a chat platform that will be integrated with the whole MOBOX platform allowing MOBOXers from around the world to talk MOMO, MBOX, and really.... anything you want to talk about.",

'Lucky Draw' will be divided into two systems 'Normal BOX Draw' & 'Advanced BOX Draw'.<br/>Normal BOX Draw: Each round will have 2000 BOXs, with no minimum veMBOX requirements. Each address can only draw 1 BOX.<br/>Advanced BOX Draw: Each round will have 18000 BOX. Each address will be limited to 1 Draw chance. The more veMBOX the more BOXs that can be drawn.

We have also fulfilled our promise to you, to get MBOX listed on a mainstream exchange.  We believe with the continued support from the community, that this is the beginning of a new era for all MOBOXers.<br/><br/>With the development of the MOBOX platform and the changes to the entire DAPP ecosystem, we will also make appropriate adjustments to ensure that MOBOXers are always at the forefront and innovating.

In order to allow us to better move forward and innovate in the GameFi sector, we will now be making the following adjustments to the DeFi section of the platform:<br/><br/>1.   August 26th : Depositing funds into the ALL Crates except for MBOX/BNB and staking of veMBOX will be halted.  Withdrawal fees from these Crates will be removed.<br/><br/>2. August 26th : veMBOX transfer function will be halted.<br/><br/>3. August 31st : MBOX airdrops to these Crates will be halted, and only MBOX/BNB airdrops will continue.  At the same time, the output of MBOX in the Crates section will be reduced.<br/><br/>4.  August 31st : All addresses with veMBOX obtained by staking in the affected Crates can be transferred to the MBOX/BNB LP Crate or GOV pool.  Team MOBOX will take out a portion of tokens from the team allocation to compensate users who are effected by the adjustment.  The actual proportion will be annouced once the adjustments are completed.  After the transfer of veMBOX, MOBOXers can still enjoy all veMBOX benefits.<br/><br/>5. Add 20 groups of Epic Quality MOMOs.
